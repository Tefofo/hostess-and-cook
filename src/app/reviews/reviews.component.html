                                            when I received an invitation to a Christmas lunch and the best part was seeing the owner and chef
                                            live in action, how she takes pride in what she does really stood out for me. She would explain what
                                            she was preparing from starters, main course to desert. Firstly the dishes she serves in are
                                            beautiful and clean and that's a very important factor if you're to enjoy your food, and my biggest
                                            moment came when the chicken wings and lamb chops were served since I'm a big fan of meat, I
                                            literally went in "hard", the g on the day was so impressed and had so much praise for the chef, a
